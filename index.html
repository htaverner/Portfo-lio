  <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
  <p>I'm Harry Taverner – a technical writer with a background in language, design, and storytelling. This is where I bring those skills together.</p>

  <h2>Tech Writing Work</h2>

  <p>I create user-centered documentation that balances clarity, tone, and structure. My approach is grounded in academic research and built for real-world users.</p>

  <p>My academic background includes a PhD in language, stylistics, and discourse analysis, with a focus on how people process information and meaning. Combined with practical experience in HTML, CSS, Markdown, and tools like GitHub and Visual Studio Code, I build documentation that is accurate, accessible, and engaging.</p>

  <h3>Key Strengths:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear procedural writing</li>
    <li>Visual documentation (tables, diagrams, infographics)</li>
    <li>Working knowledge of Python, R, HTML/CSS</li>
    <li>Git-based version control workflows</li>
    <li>Plain language and style guide alignment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I'm currently building a set of sample docs, walkthroughs, and guides to demonstrate my approach across use cases. These will be added here soon.</p>

  <h2>Graphic Design Work</h2>

  <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>

  <p>Function, clarity, and visual restraint. I design with intention, balancing typography, whitespace, and affordance to guide user interaction naturally.</p>

  <p>Although I no longer work professionally in graphic design, I still apply those skills regularly—especially in support of technical documentation.</p>

  <p>I have experience producing clean, purposeful graphics to support understanding: infographics, interface mockups, icon sets, diagrams, and more.</p>

  <h3>My Toolkit includes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign)</li>
    <li>Visuals for documentation (figures, tables, UI diagrams)</li>
    <li>SVG, PNG, and vector workflows</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sample design work will be added here soon.</p>

  <h2>Fiction Writing</h2>

  <p>Storytelling is at the core of how we connect. Over the past few years, I have written speculative short fiction across genres including science fiction, fantasy, cli-fi, and the uncanny. Several of my stories have been shortlisted for international competitions, and one has taken first place.</p>

  <p>I include them here not as a career focus, but to show creativity, voice, and empathy—skills that cross over into effective writing for any audience.</p>

  <h3>Featured Stories:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>“The History of Us” – Winner, Globe Soup 2023 Sci-Fi Competition</li>
    <li>“These Eyes”</li>
    <li>“The Whispers”</li>
  </ul>
